# Write a program the reads strings until a blank line is encountered. For each string
# entered, treat the portion of the string up to the first colon (or the entire string
# if no colon is present) as a key name, and everything after the first colon as a value.
# If the key portion has been entered before, print out the old value paired with that key,
# and then change the value to the newly entered one. After the blank line, print out a neat
# list of key value pairs.
