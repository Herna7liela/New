#5.Write a program the starts by declaring the above dictionary as a literal, then proceeds
# to switch the keys and values, so that values become keys, and vice versa. Print out the
# resulting dictionary

books = {1: "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy", 2: "The Restaurant at the End of the Universe", 3: "Life, the Universe, and Everything", 4: "So Long, and Thanks for all the Fish!", 5: "Mostly Harmless"}    

books = books.items()

# I started off by switching the two around because it made more sense to me
# not sure how to do this thing????
# maybe an extra variable to make sure that no key and value are double??
