# Write a program that accepts a list of numbers terminated by a blank line, and stores the
# result in a tuple, a. Repeat the process to form a second user inputted tuple, b, making
# sure there are the same number of elements in b as in a. Print out the result of the
# mathematical addition (not concatenation) of the two tuples as a tuple.

#input number
# add number to empty string
# change string to tuple
# print tuple
# repeat with b
# add both tuples together (+)
# print this addition
