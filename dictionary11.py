# Extend your solution to the previous problem, by allowing customers to enter multi-line
# comments, and to terminate their comments by entering a blank line. If the comment is
# entirely blank, i.e. the first line is blank, then it does not overwrite the former comment
# if any. Also, ensure that when the comments are outputted back, either because of the
# 'showcomments' command, or a repeat customer entering their name, that the line width of
# the outputted comments does not exceed 60 characters, nor break a word in two, i.e. lines
# are only broken on white space.
