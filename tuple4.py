# Write a program that accepts a list of numbers terminated by a blank line. Print out
# the entered numbers as elements of a tuple, in the order they were entered.

num1 = int(input("Enter number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter number: "))
num3 = int(input("Enter number: "))
numbers = (num1, num2, num3)
print (numbers)

# can use a while loop to make it continuos and then also use only one input
